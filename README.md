# Slashook

A webhook-based Discord slash command library.

This is a WIP project. Please note breaking changes can occur within minor releases until version 1.0.0.

## Things to be done
* REST methods for full API coverage
* Utility methods
* More validation library-side
* Tests and benchmarks

The gateway (and by extension voice) functionality is out of scope for this project.
